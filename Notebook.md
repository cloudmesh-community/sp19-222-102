KNN:
Euclidean Distance: sqrt(sum(xi-yij)^2)
Standardization (x-u)/p
To translate color into a number average all the same colors speed to determine a number for speed. Put the colors in a corresponding nearest appromixation to simlar colors. For example red = 1, black=2 , green=2 , other = 3.
By not normalizing the data certain features had a heavy weight then others. For example the year of the car and top speed were weighted very high compared to others due to the large range of values. 
If time is uttermost imporant you can speed up computation time by getting rid of the sqrt.
